# Research Q–Answer–Positioning (RAP) and Introduction

## RAP (Varanya-Style)

- **Research Question (R).** When firms jointly choose supplier intensities (extensive margin) and input quantities (intensive margin) under private signals about an aggregate fundamental, how do Bayesian beliefs interact with production complementarities to determine which supply-chain networks emerge and how they evolve over time?

- **Answer (A).** Under Acemoglu–Azar’s production technology and menu-of-subsets formulation, payoffs exhibit increasing differences in own supplier set and the relevant fundamentals. With affiliated private signals ordered by MLR, the static incomplete-information game is supermodular in the sense of Van Zandt–Vives and admits extremal Bayesian equilibria that are monotone in fundamentals. Propagating these equilibria through the (order-preserving) network law of motion yields dynamic paths whose ordering is preserved by initial conditions and shocks. Private information therefore widens—but does not destabilize—the equilibrium lattice, delivering robust comparative statics without uniqueness.

- **Positioning (P).** Relative to prevailing “endogenous network” models (e.g., Taschereau-Dumouchel and follow-ups) that assume complete information or reduced-form exposure choice, we: (i) take Acemoglu–Azar’s exact endogenous-subset technology (the extensive margin of the IO matrix); (ii) embed period-by-period private signals with affiliation; and (iii) derive existence, extremal-equilibrium lattice structure, and monotone transitional dynamics with Van Zandt–Vives and Topkis/Milgrom–Shannon. This delivers equilibrium selection-free predictions for policy shifts (signal precision, link costs) and for shock transmission with uncertainty—features not available in complete-information, deterministic approaches.

## Introduction (Acemoglu-style, sober)

Modern supply chains are reorganized under uncertainty. Firms build and unwind supplier relationships before key fundamentals are revealed, and the intensification of information flows makes upstream beliefs an input in their own right. Yet the canonical theory of input–output linkages either fixes the network or assumes common knowledge of shocks. As a consequence, we lack a framework that simultaneously (i) endogenizes the extensive margin of link formation and (ii) characterizes how private information interacts with complementarities to shape equilibrium networks and their dynamics.

We take the endogenous-subset production framework of Acemoglu and Azar (2020, Econometrica) as primitive and introduce incomplete information in the sense of Van Zandt and Vives (2007): each period, firms receive affiliated private signals about an aggregate fundamental that shifts productivities and demand. Firms then choose both their supplier intensities (the subset of upstream inputs to activate) and their input quantities. The joint presence of (i) Acemoglu–Azar’s menu-of-subsets technology, which creates complementarities across input activation, and (ii) affiliated private signals, which align incentives in the sense of monotone likelihood ratio, yields a supermodular Bayesian game. Our first result shows that the stage game admits pure-strategy Bayesian equilibria that form a complete lattice with well-defined lower and upper elements. Our second result establishes that these extremal equilibria are monotone in fundamentals, including signal precision, inherited networks, and policy parameters that enter with increasing differences. Our third result extends these properties to the dynamic setting: the law of motion for the network is order-preserving, so transition paths from different initial conditions are ordered, and a stationary Bayesian equilibrium network exists by Tarski.

The payoff is twofold. First, we retain the economic content of Acemoglu–Azar: the extensive margin matters. Equilibrium link activation responds to prices and technology via increasing differences, so policy changes and aggregate shocks propagate not only through quantities but also through the *set* of active input combinations. Second, we maintain tractability under uncertainty: rather than requiring uniqueness, our analysis provides monotone comparative statics for the extremal equilibria of the incomplete-information game. This yields equilibrium-selection-robust predictions for how network density, input purchases, and output respond to signals and policies.

### Relation to prior work

Taschereau-Dumouchel and coauthors emphasize endogenous interconnectedness, typically under complete information or with reduced-form exposure choices. Their networks are endogenous in the sense that agents choose exposure or link weights conditional on observable fundamentals. In contrast, we (i) adopt Acemoglu–Azar’s *extensive-margin* subset choice as the object of optimization; (ii) introduce *private* affiliated signals that shift productivities and demand; and (iii) prove existence, extremal lattice structure, and monotone comparative statics in a Bayesian game. Our dynamic results then provide ordered transitional dynamics under uncertainty—predictions absent in deterministic, complete-information approaches.

Beyond this distinction, our framework nests classic propagation channels (e.g., Cobb–Douglas intensities as in A&A), and matches their comparative statics when signals become perfectly informative. With imperfect information, it delivers new policy insights: increasing signal precision and lowering link adjustment costs shift both extremal equilibria in the same direction, compressing the equilibrium set and dampening selection uncertainty.
