Using novel data matching mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are underrepresented among loan officers.

These disparities are reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. These pairings also lead to lower default rates, suggesting minority loan officers have an informational advantage with minority borrowers.

News implied volatility (NVIX) captures well the disaster concerns of the average investor over this longer history. NVIX is particularly high during stock market crashes, times of policy-related uncertainty, world wars and financial crises. We find that periods when people are more concerned with a rare disaster, as proxied by news, are either followed by periods of above average stock returns, or followed by periods of large economic disasters. We estimate that the disaster probability has a half-life of four to eight months and annual volatility of 4% to 6%. Our findings are consistent with the view that hard to measure time-varying rare disaster risk is an important driver behind asset prices.",

We analyze whether high\u2010frequency traders (HFTs) lean against large institutional orders that execute through a series of child orders.

Our empirical findings are consistent with investors trading strategically on their information.

ASEAN corporate governance scorecard is measured by dummy variable, which is big 50 and non-big 50 firm's rank of highest ASEAN corporate governance scorecard. Firm value measured by Tobin's Q.  Hypothesis test uses country fixed-effect regression analysis.\n Findings: This research finds that the big 50 of highest ASEAN corporate governance scorecards have positive effect on firm value. Higher ASEAN corporate governance scorecard as improvement of rights of shareholders, equitable treatment of shareholders, role of stakeholders, disclosure and transparency, responsibilities of the board, will improve firm's value. \n Practical Implications: Management could make firm policy about optimal corporate governance, so management could maximizes shareholders' wealth by firm value increasing. Investors, who have interest send their investment abroad especially in ASEAN, have to see condition of corporate governance of public-listed firms, so investors' wealth could be maximized. \n Originality/Value: This research provides early evidence about new corporate governance formulation, especially in ASEAN, and its effect on firm value in stock markets in ASEAN.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We examine the effect of information asymmetry on equity prices in the local A\u2010 and foreign B\u2010share market in China. We construct measures of information asymmetry based on market microstructure models, and find that they explain a significant portion of cross\u2010sectional variation in B\u2010share discounts, even after controlling for other factors. On a univariate basis, the price impact measure and the adverse selection component of the bid\u2010ask spread in the A\u2010 and B\u2010share markets explains 44% and 46% of the variation in B\u2010share discounts. On a multivariate basis, both measures are far more statistically significant than any of the control variables.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to interest rate risk\u2014it hedges it. The reason is the deposit franchise, which allows banks to pay deposit rates that are low and insensitive to market interest rates. Hedging the deposit franchise requires banks to earn income that is also insensitive, that is, to lend long term at fixed rates. As predicted by this theory, we show that banks closely match the interest rate sensitivities of their interest income and expense, and that this insulates their equity from interest rate shocks. Our results explain why banks supply long\u2010term\u00a0credit.</jats:p>",

We document this result empirically using a flexible time\u2010varying parameter model that estimates predictive coefficients as a nonparametric function of time and explore possible explanations of this finding, including time\u2010varying risk premia for which we find limited support. Conversely, pockets of return predictability are consistent with a sticky expectations model in which investors slowly update their beliefs about a persistent component in the cash flow\u00a0process.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Financial institutions received investments under the Troubled Asset Relief Program in a bad state of the world but repaid them in a relatively good state. We show that the recipients paid considerably lower returns to taxpayers compared to private\u2010market securities with similar risk over the same investment horizon, resulting in a subsidy of over $50 billion on the preferred equity investment by the government. Ex\u2010post renegotiation of contract terms limited the upside gains received by taxpayers in good times and contributed to the subsidy. These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of future bailouts. Our simple methodology for calculating the subsidy can be applied to evaluate the financial costs of other\u00a0bailouts.</jats:p>",

The model is calibrated using regulatory data on the entire U.S. credit default swap (CDS) market between 2010 and 2013. Prices depend crucially on the risk-bearing capacity of core dealers, yet unlike standard models featuring a dealer sector, we allow for heterogeneity in dealer risk-bearing capacity. This heterogeneity is quantitatively important. Depending on how well dealers share risk, the exit of a single dealer can cause credit spreads to rise by 8 $\\%$ to 24$\\%$.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Because most mortgages in the United States are securitized in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), yield spreads on MBS are a key determinant of homeowners\u2019 funding costs. We study variation in MBS spreads in the time series and across securities and document that MBS spreads show a pronounced cross-sectional smile with respect to the securities\u2019 coupon rates. We present a new pricing model that uses \u201cstripped\u201d MBS prices to identify the contribution of non-interest-rate prepayment risk to spreads and find that this risk explains the smile, whereas the time-series spread variation is mostly accounted for by nonprepayment risk factors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Received March 30, 2015; editorial decision November 21, 2018 by Editor Leonid Kogan.

We also find a notable upward trend in this price between 2008 and 2014, likely due to increased legal and regulatory burden in the mortgage market.

Using data on U.S. mortgages, we predict default using traditional and machine learning models. We find that Black and Hispanic borrowers are disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning.

Trust in the manager reduces an investor's perception of the riskiness of a given investment, and allows managers to charge fees.

Our evidence challenges the view that financial crises are unpredictable \u201cbolts from the sky\u201d and supports the Kindleberger\u2010Minsky view that crises are the byproduct of predictable, boom\u2010bust credit cycles.

We find significant evidence of cross-sectional variation in risk prices for almost all combinations of test assets, factor models, and time periods considered.</jats:p>",

In our setting, directors affect their firms' governance, and governance in turn affects firms' demand for new directors. Whether the labor market rewards a shareholder\u2010friendly or management\u2010friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors' desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across firms.

This study examines the evolution of the global reserve currency system, with a particular focus on the dominance of the U.S. dollar and the growing roles of the euro, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and British pound over the past two decades. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The investigated problem&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; lies in the transformation of the essence and function of reserve currencies over the last 25 years, driven by structural shifts in the global economy, financial markets, and geopolitical dynamics. Previously unresolved aspects of this broader issue include the increasing challenges to the U.S. dollar&amp;apos;s status as the sole global anchor currency, especially from emerging powers such as BRICS. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The analysis of recent research and publications&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; highlights a wide range of scholarly and institutional perspectives, including works by Bertaut, Gopinath, Eichengreen, Rogoff, Bracke, and Bunda, along with research conducted by the IMF, Federal Reserve, World Bank, ECB, and BIS.

The study also presents forecasts based on purchasing power parity, indicating the increasing economic weight of BRICS in global GDP. The area of practical application involves policy planning by governments that continue to rely on the U.S. dollar as an anchor currency. Innovative technological approaches identified include enhanced prudential oversight by central banks and the development of adaptive exchange rate policies in response to growing financial risks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The scope of these innovations&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; also includes strategies to redirect European savings into high-tech sectors that stimulate sustainable growth and reduce systemic dependence on the dollar.

Reproducibility is higher for researchers with better coding skills and those exerting more effort. It is lower for more technical research questions, more complex code, and results lying in the tails of the distribution. Researchers exhibit overconfidence when assessing the reproducibility of their own research. We provide guidelines for finance researchers and discuss implementable reproducibility policies for academic journals.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We investigate how the deregulation of the French banking industry in the 1980s affected the real behavior of firms and the structure and dynamics of product markets. Following deregulation, banks are less willing to bail out poorly performing firms and firms in the more bank\u2010dependent sectors are more likely to undertake restructuring activities. At the industry level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in concentration. Overall, these findings support the view that a more efficient banking sector helps foster a Schumpeterian process of \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d</jats:p>",

Moreover, stock prices track firm productivity and this tracking is equally strong for diversified and stand\u2010alone firms. Therefore, lower transparency of conglomerates is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between productivity and stock prices on average. Finally, I offer some evidence that this discrepancy may arise because conglomerates dissipate rents in the form of higher wages.</jats:p>",

    "answer": "The competitive equilibrium features information dispersion and partial disclosure, where conflicted fees distort information quality but do not affect customer welfare. Banning conflicted fees improves information quality but not welfare, while financial literacy education for the least informed customers can improve welfare for all customers through spillover effects.",

We show that scrutiny has important implications for both the form of security designed and the amount of inefficient retention of cash flows. The model predicts that issuers will design informationally sensitive securities (i.e., levered equity) when scrutiny is sufficiently intense. Otherwise, issuers opt for a standard debt contract. Scrutiny increases efficiency by decreasing issuers\u2019 reliance on retention to signal quality and, perhaps counterintuitively, decrease price informativeness.</jats:p>",

The late 19th century US provides a unique context to evaluate the real effects of supplying a new type of money that is safe from default. We measure the local change in \"monetary\" transaction frictions with a market access approach derived from general equilibrium trade theory. Consistent with theories hypothesizing that lowering transaction frictions benefits the traded and inputs-intensive sectors, we find an increase in traded goods production, in the share of manufacturing output and employment, and in innovation.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We conduct a study in which subjects trade stocks in an experimental market while we measure their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. All of the subjects trade in a suboptimal way. We use the neural data to test a \u201crealization utility\u201d explanation for their behavior. We find that activity in two areas of the brain that are important for economic decision\u2010making exhibit activity consistent with the predictions of realization utility. These results provide support for the realization utility model. More generally, they demonstrate that neural data can be helpful in testing models of investor behavior.</jats:p>",

The degree of predictability, as measured by alpha spreads from quintile sorts or cross-sectional regression slopes, falls by at least half post-sample.

We find no evidence that the declines are the result of data snooping or learning by investors or fund managers.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We report evidence from a randomized field experiment conducted by a major student loan servicer, Navient, in which student loan borrowers received prepopulated applications for income\u2010driven repayment (IDR) plans. Treatment increased IDR enrollment by 34 percentage points relative to the control group. Using the random treatment assignment as an instrument for IDR enrollment, we furthermore provide local average treatment effect (LATE) estimates of the effects of IDR enrollment on new delinquencies, monthly student loan payments, and consumer spending. Our study is the first field\u2010experimental evaluation of a U.S. government program designed to address the soaring debt burdens of U.S. households.</jats:p>",

Financing costs of bonds with potential dual advisor-underwriters fall by 11.4 basis points after the advisor is no longer allowed to underwrite. The decline follows from increases in standardization, third-party certification, and auction participation, all of which are consistent with limiting the adverse selection that arises from advisors withholding information from the market.

    "answer": "Yes, fund managers do inflate quarter-end portfolio prices with last-minute purchases of stocks already held, with price inflation ranging from 0.5 percent per year for large-cap funds to over 2 percent for small-cap funds, and this behavior is driven by incentives from the flow/performance relationship.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper provides new empirical evidence of a specific type of gaming behavior in mutual funds - quarter-end price inflation through strategic trading - and demonstrates that this behavior is systematically related to fund managers' incentives from the documented flow/performance relationship in the mutual fund literature."

We exploit a large\u2010scale reform of French unemployment benefits that insured unemployed workers starting businesses. The reform significantly increased firm creation without decreasing the quality of new entrants. Firms started postreform were initially smaller, but their employment growth, productivity, and survival rates are similar to those prereform. New entrepreneurs' characteristics and expectations are also similar. Finally, jobs created by new entrants crowd out employment in incumbent firms almost one\u2010for\u2010one, but have a higher productivity than incumbents. These results highlight the benefits of encouraging experimentation by lowering barriers to\u00a0entry.</jats:p>",

Managers' perceptions of fundamental value diverge systematically from market valuations, and perceived mispricing seems an important determinant of managers' decision making. Insider trading patterns shows that low valuation firms are regarded as undervalued by their own managers relative to high valuation firms. This finding is robust to controlling for noninformation motivated trading. Further evidence links managers' private portfolio decisions to changes in corporate capital structures, suggesting that managers try to actively time the market both in their private trades and in firm\u2010level decisions.</jats:p>",

These models predict that the term structures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespecified interval) are also upward sloping. However, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. This discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios. Under such policies, shareholders are forced to divest (invest) when leverage is low (high), which shifts risk from long\u2010 to short\u2010horizon dividend strips.</jats:p>",

Nearly 75$\\%$ of loan agreements include restrictions that limit borrower acquisition decisions throughout the life of the contract.

    "answer": "Positive investment shocks at one plant cause financially constrained firms to reallocate capital and labor from other plants (especially less productive, non-core, and geographically distant plants) to the treated plant, resulting in increased aggregate firm-wide productivity. This reallocation effect does not occur in financially unconstrained firms.",

For sample sizes and models similar to those used in most empirical work, we reach three surprising conclusions. First, while maximum likelihood works well for simple models, it produces strongly biased parameter estimates when the model includes a flexible specification of the dynamics of interest rate risk. Second, despite having the same asymptotic efficiency as maximum likelihood, the small-sample performance of Efficient Method of Moments (a commonly used method for estimating complicated models) is unacceptable even in the simplest term structure settings. Third, the linearized Kalman filter is a tractable and reasonably accurate estimation technique, which we recommend in settings where maximum likelihood is impractical.</jats:p>",

    "answer": "Pass-through rates significantly affect both export and import prices, with surprisingly higher pass-through for local currency-priced goods (contrary to existing literature). The relative pass-through rates to U.S. dollar and euro-priced goods depend on product type and value-added trade, while stronger global value chain integration and vehicle currency use tend to smooth domestic price responses to exchange rate changes.",

    "answer": "Lower nominal interest rates reduce the cost of liquidity, which encourages banks to increase leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth. The central bank influences risk premia by changing the liquidity premium through the nominal rate, which affects banks' cost of taking leverage.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper develops a new dynamic asset pricing model that explicitly links monetary policy to risk premia through a banking sector mechanism involving leverage and liquidity buffers, extending beyond traditional models to analyze specific monetary policy tools like forward guidance and the 'Greenspan put.'"

Using transactions data from 2003 to 2009, we show that the illiquidity in corporate bonds is substantial, significantly greater than what can be explained by bid\u2013ask spreads. We establish a strong link between bond illiquidity and bond prices. In aggregate, changes in market\u2010level illiquidity explain a substantial part of the time variation in yield spreads of high\u2010rated (AAA through A) bonds, overshadowing the credit risk component.

In our experiments, subjects each allocate $10,000 across four S&amp;P 500 index funds and are rewarded for their portfolio's subsequent return. Subjects overwhelmingly fail to minimize fees. We reject the hypothesis that subjects buy high-fee index funds because of bundled nonportfolio services. Search costs for fees matter, but even when we eliminate these costs, fees are not minimized. Instead, subjects place high weight on annualized returns since inception. Fees paid decrease with financial literacy. Interestingly, subjects who choose high-fee funds sense they are making a mistake.</jats:p>",

We construct a novel data set containing the employment histories and loan portfolios of a large sample of corporate bankers and find that corporate credit events (i.e., downgrades, defaults, bankruptcies) increase banker turnover. The effect is pronounced when bankers issue loans with loose terms or experience severe losses. Credit events prompt bankers to adopt stricter future risk management practices, such as offering restrictive covenant packages. Overall, our findings are consistent with banks disciplining employees as a means to manage their own risk exposure.</jats:p>",

A large proportion of the total equity premium is realized on days with macroeconomic announcements. The relation between market betas and expected returns is far stronger on announcement days as compared with nonannouncement days. Finally, these results hold for fixed-income investments as well as for stocks. We present a model in which agents learn the probability of an adverse economic state on announcement days. We show that the model quantitatively accounts for the empirical findings. Evidence from options data provides support for the model\u2019s mechanism.</jats:p>",

Firms are modeled as long\u2010lived assets distinguished by the timing of cash flows. The stochastic discount factor is specified so that shocks to aggregate dividends are priced, but shocks to the discount rate are not. The model implies that growth firms covary more with the discount rate than do value firms, which covary more with cash flows. When calibrated to explain aggregate stock market behavior, the model accounts for the observed value premium, the high Sharpe ratios on value firms, and the poor performance of the CAPM.</jats:p>",

It also indicates the percentage of a company's revenue that is distributed to investors. The objective was to establish the effect of operational efficiency on the financial performance of manufacturing firms listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. Kenya.\r\nMethodology: The study was supported by efficient market hypothesis theory. The study employed a descriptive research design. The study targeted a population of 9 manufacturing firms listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya as of 31st December 2024.A census of all the 9 manufacturing firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange was used as a unit of analysis. Data was gathered from secondary sources through a secondary data collection sheet. Data was sourced from financial and statistical reports released by the NSE and the KMA. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.\r\nFindings: The findings of the panel regression model indicated a positive and significant effect between operational efficiency and the financial performance of manufacturing firms listed at the NSE, Kenya.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends that manufacturing firms listed at the NSE should develop strategies to establish a firm-specific optimization framework designed to enhance the financial performance of NSE-listed manufacturing firms by integrating and addressing key internal characteristics that influence profitability and sustainability. By adopting a targeted and evidence-based approach through the firm-specific optimization framework, Kenya can empower its manufacturing firms to thrive within their unique structural contexts. Such alignment is not only beneficial to individual firms but is also essential to achieving national development goals under Vision 2030 and the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda.</jats:p>",

Importantly, within this direct\u2010sold segment, we find no evidence that actively managed funds underperform index funds.

    "answer": "The underperformance of actively managed funds is explained by distribution channel differences: direct-sold funds face stronger incentives to generate alpha (as flows chase risk-adjusted returns) and do not underperform index funds, while broker-sold funds face weaker alpha-generation incentives and significantly underperform index funds.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the macroeconomic effect on Registered Real Estate Investments Trusts (REITs) financial performance in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMaterials and Methods: Causal research design was used to describe the REITs financial performance. This study used the population comprising of thirteen REITs firms in Kenya. The entire population (census) was used for the study. This study utilized secondary sources of data to get the information required to satisfy the research objectives. Time series data on REITs financial performance was computed for a four-year period as at 1st January 2016 to 31stDecember 2019, thus making use of 4 data points. The process of data analysis entailed preparation of the collected data through cleaning, editing and coding so that statistics could be keyed in the SPSS (statistical package for social sciences) package. The data was presented through tables and figures&#x0D;\nResults: \u00a0The regression model results without the moderating variable showed that R = 0.792, R\u00b2 = 0.627 indicating that 62.7% of the variance in the REITs financial performance can be accounted for by the independent variables (macroeconomic variables). On the other hand, the regression model results with the moderating variable showed that R = 0.838, R\u00b2 = 0.703 indicating that 70.3% of the variance in the REITs financial performance can be accounted for by the independent variables (macroeconomic variables) and the moderating variable considered in this study.\u00a0&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that the government and REITs stakeholders should focus on policies and strategies that encourage favorable balance of payment in Kenya. REITs develop and design their products to suit consumers tastes and preferences to ensure their increased as consumption increases. Lastly, the government should expand the money supply to lower the inflation rates through tight fiscal and economic policies.</jats:p>",

The study targeted a population of 9 manufacturing firms listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya as of 31st December 2024.A census of all the 9 manufacturing firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange was used as a unit of analysis. Data was gathered from secondary sources through a secondary data collection sheet. Data was sourced from financial and statistical reports released by the NSE and the KMA. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.\r\nFindings: The findings of the panel regression model indicated a positive and significant effect between operational efficiency and the financial performance of manufacturing firms listed at the NSE, Kenya.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends that manufacturing firms listed at the NSE should develop strategies to establish a firm-specific optimization framework designed to enhance the financial performance of NSE-listed manufacturing firms by integrating and addressing key internal characteristics that influence profitability and sustainability. By adopting a targeted and evidence-based approach through the firm-specific optimization framework, Kenya can empower its manufacturing firms to thrive within their unique structural contexts. Such alignment is not only beneficial to individual firms but is also essential to achieving national development goals under Vision 2030 and the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda.</jats:p>",

    "title": "EFFECT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN KENYA OF REGISTERED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS TRUSTS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the macroeconomic effect on Registered Real Estate Investments Trusts (REITs) financial performance in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMaterials and Methods: Causal research design was used to describe the REITs financial performance. This study used the population comprising of thirteen REITs firms in Kenya. The entire population (census) was used for the study. This study utilized secondary sources of data to get the information required to satisfy the research objectives. Time series data on REITs financial performance was computed for a four-year period as at 1st January 2016 to 31stDecember 2019, thus making use of 4 data points. The process of data analysis entailed preparation of the collected data through cleaning, editing and coding so that statistics could be keyed in the SPSS (statistical package for social sciences) package. The data was presented through tables and figures&#x0D;\nResults: \u00a0The regression model results without the moderating variable showed that R = 0.792, R\u00b2 = 0.627 indicating that 62.7% of the variance in the REITs financial performance can be accounted for by the independent variables (macroeconomic variables). On the other hand, the regression model results with the moderating variable showed that R = 0.838, R\u00b2 = 0.703 indicating that 70.3% of the variance in the REITs financial performance can be accounted for by the independent variables (macroeconomic variables) and the moderating variable considered in this study.\u00a0&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that the government and REITs stakeholders should focus on policies and strategies that encourage favorable balance of payment in Kenya. REITs develop and design their products to suit consumers tastes and preferences to ensure their increased as consumption increases. Lastly, the government should expand the money supply to lower the inflation rates through tight fiscal and economic policies.</jats:p>",

The CIO allocates capital to the managers who, in turn, allocate these funds to the assets in their asset class. This two\u2010step investment process causes several misalignments of objectives between the CIO and his managers and can lead to large utility costs for the CIO. We focus on (1) loss of diversification, (2) unobservable managerial appetite for risk, and (3) different investment horizons. We derive an optimal unconditional linear performance benchmark and show that this benchmark can be used to better align incentives within the firm. We find that the CIO's uncertainty about the managers' risk appetites increases both the costs of decentralized investment management and the value of an optimally designed benchmark.</jats:p>",

As theory predicts, probability weighting is positively associated with portfolio underdiversification and significant Sharpe ratio losses. Analyzing respondents\u2019 individual stock holdings, we find higher probability weighting is associated with owning lottery-type stocks and positively skewed equity portfolios. People with higher probability weighting are less likely to own mutual funds and more likely to either avoid equities or hold individual stocks. We are the first to empirically link individuals\u2019 elicited probability weighting and real-world decisions under risk.</jats:p>",

    "answer": "The V-shaped relationship between oil futures price volatility and forward curve slope is explained by time-varying supply elasticity caused by investment constraints in oil production. When firms face irreversible and capacity-constrained investment decisions, supply elasticity changes over time, and since demand shocks must be absorbed by either price or supply changes, this results in time-varying volatility of futures prices that creates the observed V-shape pattern.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper identifies a new stylized fact that cannot be explained by standard storage-based models in the existing literature, and fills this gap by developing a novel equilibrium model of oil production that incorporates investment irreversibility and capacity constraints to explain the previously unexplained V-shaped volatility pattern."

The wedge between model\u2010implied and observed derivative prices reflects the impact of nonrisk\u2010based IC because our SDF incorporates risk\u2010based IC. There is no wedge at short horizons, while the wedge accounts for 40% of long\u2010term CIP violations. Consistent with IC theory, the wedge correlates with the shadow cost of intermediary capital, and the SDF\u2010implied interest rate is a weighted average of collateralized and uncollateralized interest\u00a0rates.</jats:p>",

Using the mortgage market as a laboratory, we conjecture that lenders with a large share of outstanding mortgages on their balance sheets internalize the negative spillovers associated with the liquidation of defaulting mortgages and thus are less inclined to foreclose. We provide evidence consistent with our conjecture. Arguably as a consequence, zip codes with a higher concentration of outstanding mortgages experience smaller house prices declines.

    "positioning_statement": "This paper introduces a new theoretical mechanism called the 'maturity rat race' to explain short-term financing patterns, particularly focusing on how strategic interactions between borrowers and multiple creditors lead to suboptimal maturity structures, with the dynamic being driven by interim information about default probability rather than recovery rates."

    "answer": "Reorganization adds value through higher debt capacity, lower credit spreads, and improved firm value in the first-best outcome, but when borrowers control reorganization timing and liquidation decisions, they appropriate most benefits ex post. Lenders can restore first-best outcomes by seizing control or through ex post transfer of control rights, leading to more frequent reorganization and less frequent liquidation compared to liquidation-only scenarios.",

We find that policy discretion is an important contributor to aggregate risk.

However, it also coincides with bad news about long-term financial conditions in the form of higher risk premiums on long-term nominal bonds. Shocks to the rule correlate with changes in the yield curve\u2019s level. Shocks to discretion correlate with changes in its slope.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Tanzania's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) focuses among other efforts at reducing income poverty, improving human capabilities, survival and social well being and containing extreme vulnerability among the poor. In this context access of households and firms to physical and financial resources is extremely crucial. For the majority of Tanzanians who are poor, without access to formal financial institutions, access to micro finance services is a viable alternative in an attempt to reduce poverty. Micro finance institutions (MFIs) offer the poor, the possibility of managing scarce resources more efficiently and taking advantage of investment opportunities for economic returns. Access to finance services may contribute to increased income generation and thus achievement of higher standards of living at household levels while at enterprise levels it can facilitate the pursuit of income and firms growth. The operations of MFIs need therefore to have greater outreach particulars where the poor are concentrated, i.e. in the rural settings. At the same time services ought to be sustainable in order to have impact on poverty alleviation.",

A bidder's indication of interest reveals that she is optimistic about the target. If bidders' values have a substantial common component, as in takeover battles between financial bidders, this effect disincentivizes bidders from indicating interest, and auctions are seller\u2010initiated. Conversely, in private\u2010value auctions, such as battles between strategic bidders, equilibria can feature both seller\u2010 and bidder\u2010initiated auctions, with the likelihood of the latter decreasing in commonality of values and the probability of a forced sale by the seller.

    "answer": "Auction initiation depends on the degree of common versus private value components in bidders' valuations. When values have substantial common components (as with financial bidders), bidders avoid indicating interest because it reveals optimism to competitors, leading to seller-initiated auctions. In private-value settings (strategic bidders), both seller- and bidder-initiated auctions can occur in equilibrium, with bidder initiation becoming less likely as value commonality increases or when forced sales are more probable.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper addresses a gap in auction theory by endogenizing the initiation decision in takeover auctions, distinguishing between different types of bidders (financial vs. strategic) and examining how the common versus private value nature of bidder valuations affects who initiates auctions - a question not previously addressed in the takeover auction literature."

    "answer": "The gap between valuations (average Q) and investment (marginal q) can be decomposed into three components: the value of installed intangibles, rents generated by physical capital, and rents generated by intangibles. The intangible-related terms contribute significantly to this gap, particularly in fast-growing sectors.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper contributes to the literature by developing a Q+ framework that can quantify and separate the effects of both rents and intangible capital on the valuation-investment gap, cautioning against pure-rents interpretations given the rising importance of intangibles in the economy."

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Social status concerns influence investors' decisions by driving a wedge in attitudes toward aggregate and idiosyncratic risks. I model such concerns by emphasizing the desire to \u201cget ahead of the Joneses,\u201d which implies that aversion to idiosyncratic risk is lower than aversion to aggregate risk. The model predicts that investors hold concentrated portfolios in equilibrium, which helps rationalize the small premium for undiversified entrepreneurial risk. In the model, status concerns are more important for wealthier households. Consequently, these households own a disproportionate share of risky assets, particularly private equity, and experience greater volatility of consumption, consistent with empirical evidence.</jats:p>",

We find that borrowers seek credit from banks that specialize in their export destinations, both when expanding exports and when exporting to new countries.

Specialized bank credit supply shocks affect exports disproportionately to countries of specialization.

Using administrative data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we document declines in startup entry\u2014particularly among riskier entrants\u2014and closures of existing firms after these laws pass.

    "answer": "The key finding is that disclosure behavior and market outcomes depend critically on whether investors know if the manager is informed. When the manager is known to be informed, disclosure increases with market liquidity and stocks trade at a discount. However, when there is uncertainty about the manager's information, disclosure can decrease with market liquidity and stocks can trade at a premium. Additionally, public information can actually increase voluntary disclosure, contrary to common intuition.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper extends existing voluntary disclosure literature by incorporating the novel element of managers disclosing to privately informed (rather than uninformed) investors, and by distinguishing between scenarios where the manager's information status is known versus uncertain, leading to counterintuitive results that challenge conventional wisdom about disclosure and market liquidity relationships."

    "answer": "Even risk-neutral hedge fund managers with option-like high-water mark contracts do not take unlimited risk, but instead behave like constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investors, placing a constant fraction in mean-variance efficient portfolios and the rest in riskless assets due to the indefinite horizon of their contracts.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that convex compensation schemes alone drive excessive risk-taking, demonstrating that risk-seeking incentives require both finite horizons and convex compensation rather than convexity alone."

    "title": "ESG Score and Mutual Fund Performance : Empirical Evidence from India",
    "abstract": "This paper studied the relationship between risk-adjusted returns and ESG disclosures of mutual funds operating in India for 13 years. It tested whether the mutual funds with higher ESG scores generated higher risk-adjusted returns than those with lower ESG scores. Further, it also tested whether the mutual funds with higher ESG scores performed better during the COVID-19 crisis period. After controlling for Fama-French five factors, we found that the performance of mutual funds with higher ESG scores neither generated significant positive alphas during the normal period nor the COVID-19 period. The results pointed toward the higher cost of being socially responsible through higher screening costs, opportunity costs, etc. These findings will interest investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders regarding the perceived advantage of investing in socially responsible mutual funds. \u00a9 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Our model identifies strong investor clienteles for stock characteristics, most notably firm age and share price, and for particular clusters of stock characteristics. These clienteles are intuitively associated with investor attributes such as account age, size, and diversification. Coheld stocks tend to have higher return covariance, inconsistent with simple models of diversification but suggestive that clientele demands influence stock\u00a0returns.</jats:p>",

    "answer": "Periodic one-sided electronic auctions are a viable and important source of liquidity even in inactively traded instruments, and these mechanisms can coexist with traditional voice trading as a natural compromise between bilateral search in OTC markets and continuous double auctions.",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper positions itself as studying an innovation in electronic trading technology that enables simultaneous search across multiple bond dealers, presenting electronic auctions as a middle ground between existing bilateral search mechanisms in OTC markets and continuous double auctions in electronic limit order books."

    "answer": "Execution prices have a nonmonotone relationship with network size - initially declining as insurers add more dealers but increasing once networks exceed 20 dealers. This relationship can be explained by insurers trading off the benefits of repeat business relationships against faster execution from larger networks.",

    "abstract": "We show that product differentiation reduces the informativeness of a firm\u2019s stock price (or its peers\u2019 stock prices) about the value of its growth opportunities. This results in less efficient exercise of a firm\u2019s growth options when managers rely on information in stock prices for their decisions. This informational cost of differentiation induces conformity in product market strategies and is larger for private firms. Hence, a firm should differentiate more after going public. We confirm this prediction empirically and show that the post-IPO increase in differentiation is stronger for firms with better informed managers or less informative peers\u2019 stock prices.Received January 19, 2016; editorial decision May 8, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

We show theoretically that the availability of short\u2010term\u2010oriented data can induce forecasters to optimally shift their attention from the long term to the short term because it reduces the cost of obtaining short\u2010term information. Consequently, the informativeness of their long\u2010term forecasts decreases, even though the informativeness of their short\u2010term forecasts increases.

To answer this question, we estimate a dynamic model of finance and investment with three mechanisms that misalign managerial and shareholder incentives: limited managerial ownership of the firm, compensation based on firm size, and managerial perquisite consumption. We find that perquisite consumption critically impacts cash policy. Size\u2010based compensation also matters, but less. Firms with lower blockholder and institutional ownership have higher managerial perquisite consumption, low managerial ownership is a key factor in the secular upward trend in cash holdings, and agency plays little role in small firms' substantial cash holdings.</jats:p>",

We estimate a dynamic model in which a taxable firm seeks financing for investment, and a dynamic contracting environment motivates endogenous collateral constraints. Optimal leverage stays a safe distance from the constraint, balancing the tax benefit of debt with the cost of lost financial flexibility. We estimate this flexibility cost to be 7.2% of firm assets, a percentage that is comparable to the tax benefit. Models with different tax rates fit the data equally well, and leverage responds to the tax rate only when taxes are low.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Received January 20, 2015; accepted January 8, 2016 by Editor Itay Goldstein.</jats:p>",

The nonlinear machine learning models generate statistically and economically sizable profits in the long-short portfolios of equity options even after accounting for transaction costs. Although option-based characteristics are the most important standalone predictors, stock-based measures offer substantial incremental predictive power when considered alongside option-based characteristics.

    "answer": "No, idiosyncratic risk does not really matter for market returns. The previously documented positive relationship between average stock volatility and market returns is driven by small Nasdaq stocks, partly reflects a liquidity premium, and does not hold in extended samples or when using alternative volatility measures (median and value-weighted average).",
    "positioning_statement": "This paper challenges the findings of Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003) who documented a significantly positive relation between equal-weighted average stock volatility and value-weighted portfolio returns, by showing their results are not robust to different samples, stock exchanges, and volatility measurement approaches."

We provide evidence supporting this prediction, suggesting that a quantitatively sizable fraction of risk premium variation in several large asset classes such as credit or mortgage\u2010backed securities (MBS) is due to intermediaries.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Since October 2008, fixed rates for interest rate swaps with a 30-year maturity have been mostly below Treasury rates with the same maturity. Under standard assumptions, this implies the existence of arbitrage opportunities. This paper presents a model for pricing interest rate swaps, where frictions for holding bonds limit arbitrage. I analytically show that negative swap spreads should not be surprising. In the calibrated model, swap spreads can reasonably match empirical counterparts without the need for large demand imbalances in the swap market. Empirical evidence is consistent with the relation between term spreads and swap spreads in the model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Received April 16, 2017; editorial decision Januray 3, 2019 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.</jats:p>",

We show that insurance companies reach for yield in choosing their investments.

However, conditional on credit ratings, insurance portfolios are systematically biased toward higher yield, higher CDS bonds. This behavior is related to the business cycle being most pronounced during economic expansions. It is also characteristic of firms with poor corporate governance and for which the regulatory capital requirement is more binding.</jats:p>",

Unlike traditional maintenance covenants, incurrence covenants preserve equity control rights but impose specific contractual restrictions on the borrower once certain financial thresholds are crossed. Contrary to the prevailing view that incurrence covenants have limited practical impact, we document a substantial decline in investment when these covenants are triggered. During economic downturns, these provisions can become binding well before default or bankruptcy. Our findings reveal a novel channel through which economic shocks propagate, driven by incurrence-based contractual restrictions that are widespread in the highly leveraged corporate sector.</jats:p>",

    "answer": "Institutional investors widely engage in behind-the-scenes intervention and governance-motivated exit as complementary mechanisms, with intervention typically occurring before potential exit. Long-term investors and those less concerned about stock liquidity intervene more intensively, and most investors rely on proxy advisors to improve their voting decisions.",
