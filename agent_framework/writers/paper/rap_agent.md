# Agent Template: rap.md

## Purpose
To define the core identity of the paper: the Research Question, the Answer (Mechanism), and the Positioning (Contribution). This file serves as the "North Star" for the entire project.

## 1. The RAP Components (The Gold Standard)

### R: Research Question
* **Format:** A single, precise question ending in a question mark.
* **Criteria:** Must be specific. Not "What is the effect of X on Y?" but "Does X increase Y by mechanism Z?"
* **Constraint:** It must be an open question given the Positioning (P).

### A: Answer (The Mechanism)
* **Format:** A concise statement of the finding and *why* it happens.
* **Criteria:** Must be the direct logical answer to R.
* **Constraint:** Do not bury the lede. State the answer immediately.

### P: Positioning (The Contribution)
* **Format:** Flexible. Often starts with context/literature and pivots with "However..."
* **Criteria:** Must clearly distinguish the paper from existing work.
* **Constraint:** P must "make space" for R. (i.e., "We know X [Context]. However, we don't know Y [Gap].").
* **Tip:** Follow Varanya Chaubey's lead: Context $\to$ Complication $\to$ Question.

## 2. The Three Logical Checks
Before proceeding, the RAP must pass these strict logic tests:
1.  **Does P make space for R?** (Does the literature review prove that R is currently unanswered?)
2.  **Does A answer R?** (Is the Answer a direct grammatical and logical response to the Question?)
3.  **Does A answer the "Idle Question"?** (When a reader sees P, they naturally ask "So what about...?" Does A answer that specific curiosity?)

## 3. Key Concepts (The "Rhyme")
* **Definition:** A list of 3-5 specific terms that define the paper's mechanism.
* **Rule:** These terms must be used consistently throughout the entire paper (RAP -> Skeleton -> Prose).
* **Example:** If you define the agent as a "Liquidity Provider," do NOT call them a "Market Maker" or "Intermediary" in later sections. Stick to "Liquidity Provider."

## 3. Core Testable Hypothesis
* **Definition:** The central claim that must be true for the paper to work.
* **Format:** "If [Mechanism] is true, then we should observe [Observable Consequence] in the data."
* **Role:** This hypothesis drives the "Discovery Phase" testing loop.

## 4. Drafting the Introduction (The "Sales Pitch")
The RAP *is* the core argument of the introduction.

### A. The Rules
1.  **Flexibility:** Do not be rigid. You do not need exactly 5 paragraphs.
2.  **The RAP Requirement:** The **R** (Question), **A** (Answer), and **P** (Positioning) must be stated clearly within the **first three paragraphs**. The order is flexible (e.g., P $\to$ R $\to$ A, or R $\to$ A $\to$ P).
3.  **The Topic Sentence Story:** The first sentence of *every* paragraph in the introduction must tell a coherent story when read in sequence.
    *   *Test:* Copy-paste just the first sentences. Do they form a smooth, logical abstract of the paper?

### B. The Flow (Guideline, not Law)
*   **The Hook:** Start with the real world or a broad puzzle.
*   **The Pivot:** Move quickly to your specific Question (R).
*   **The Answer:** State your Mechanism (A) clearly. Don't bury it.
*   **The Contribution:** Define your Positioning (P) relative to the literature.
*   **The Roadmap:** Briefly preview the rest of the paper (optional, but common).

### Coherence Check
*   **Test:** Does the transition from the Puzzle to the RAP feel inevitable?
*   **Test:** Is the Mechanism explained simply enough for a non-economist?
*   **Test:** If you get stuck writing this, **STOP**. Go back to the RAP definition. The idea is not ready.
