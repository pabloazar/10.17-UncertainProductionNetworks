Please review the attached paper revision and the diff showing changes.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** We are actively working on the "Theory-to-Data Mapping Table" and empirical section upgrades (addressing Grok's feedback). Please **ignore the missing empirics table** for this round and focus your review on the **theoretical model updates**, specifically:
1. The new microfoundation of $Y_t$ (Definition 4b)
2. The corrected FOC and budget constraints (Section 3.2)
3. The proof of Proposition 5 (Assumption of martingale convergence)
4. The integration with the AHP 2007 framework

Your goal is to verify if the **math and model structure** are now solid.
4. **What should I prioritize next?**

Be strict, frank, and professional—like a top economist giving a second-round review.
