Your task: **Check the math, identify any fatal mistakes, and suggest specific rewrites.**

Please:
1. **Check all mathematical derivations** for algebraic correctness (especially in Sections 2 and 3).
2. **Verify the Equilibrium definition** is complete: Are Preferences, Technology, Information Structure, Budget Constraints, and Market Clearing all explicitly defined?
3. **Critically evaluate proofs** of Theorem 1 and Propositions 3 & 4. Are there logical gaps or questionable steps?
4. **Identify any fatal mistakes** that would invalidate the main results. If you find one, mark it clearly as **FATAL ERROR**.
5. **Suggest specific rewrites** for sections that need clarification or better mathematical exposition, especially the Comparative Statics.
6. **Flag notation inconsistencies** or undefined variables.

Be strict, frank, and professional—like a top economist giving detailed feedback to a colleague.
