# Implementation Plan: AAVZ Paper Production

## Objective
Transform the current technical notes into a 10-15 page Econometrica/QJE-quality paper draft following the agent framework workflow.

## Phase 1: RAP Definition (Step 1)

### Deliverable: `rap.md`
Define the core identity:
- **R** (Research Question): Precise question about production network formation under uncertainty
- **A** (Answer): The mechanism—CES complementarities + affiliated signals → extremal monotone BNE
- **P** (Positioning): Gap in literature (A&A complete info, VZV abstract games, no production network application)

### Three Logical Checks
1. Does P make space for R?
2. Does A answer R?
3. Does A answer the "Idle Question"?

## Phase 2: Skeleton (Step 8)

### Deliverable: `skeleton.md`
For each section:
- **Heading** (reveals argument)
- **Takeaway** (one-sentence conclusion)
- **Leading Text** (topic sentences for each paragraph)

### Structure
1. Introduction (RAP)
2. Setup: Production Networks under Uncertainty
3. The Main Result: Existence of Extremal Monotone Equilibria
4. Comparative Statics and Policy Implications
5. Dynamic Extension
6. Discussion
7. Conclusion

## Phase 3: Full Paper Draft (Step 9)

### Deliverable: `paper.md` (10-15 pages)

### Style Guidelines (Acemoglu Sober)
- No rhetoric ("obviously", "crucially")
- Lead with conclusions, not buildup
- Consistent terminology ("Key Concepts")
- Every claim proven or cited
- Simple models, clear intuition

### Key Concepts (Rhyme)
- **Supplier set** (not "network links", "IO matrix")
- **Monotone equilibrium** (not "ordered BNE")
- **Affiliated signals** (not "correlated information")
- **Strategic complementarities** (not "positive spillovers")

## Execution Timeline

| Step | Deliverable | Est. Size |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | `rap.md` | 1 page |
| 2 | `skeleton.md` | 2-3 pages |
| 3 | `paper.md` | 12-15 pages |

---

## Success Criteria
- Passes "Skim Test": Reading only headings + topic sentences tells the full story
- Passes "Three Logical Checks"
- No "rhetorical" words
- Full proofs (not citations as crutches)
